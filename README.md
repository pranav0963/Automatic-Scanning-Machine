# Automatic-Scanning-Machine

## Probelm:
Digitization of printed material is needed in the current scenario to preserve the document as well as wider reach of the script to all the parts of the world. Handling of all hardcopies of books is a very tedious job and high investment is required to build a proper storage place with controlled environmental conditions. But a big problem is how do we digitalize such huge number of books within less time.

## Solution:
Our model would be able to flip pages on its own and scan number of books with minimal human intervention. The scanned image is converted to digital text using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technique. Our model also converts text to audio to help differently abled people hear the audio of any specific and rare hardcopies they are interested in reading. Our project hardware part is completely controlled by arduino, whereas software part is taken care by python using libraries such as opencv, PIL, pyteserract.

## uniqueness:
The uniqueness of our idea is to provide an economical solution by replacing expensive scanners with smartphones. Using mobile phones also makes the device portable, light weight and the process of installation easier.

## competitors:
The products that are available in the market at present are just kind of tools that help in the manual process of clicking pictures easier. Its is actually a dynamic framework structure that has to be moved by people and flip pages manually, whereas our machine can flip and also take pictures automatically. If a person just needs to place a book into our product


## key benefits:
The benefits of using "Automatic Scanning Machine" are such as:
1) Saves a lot of time for people
2) Easy creation of audio books
3) Saves money in terms of not having huge libraries and storage places for such massive amount of books
4) User-friendly
5) Wide range of domains of target users

## Target users:
1) Digitizing Old manuscripts to last long.
2) Storing important Documents: Much of the paperwork involved in different fields like Research, Medicine, Court of law and other government organizations.
3) Rare books and running notes: A professorâ€™s book can be shared to many which saves lots of time.
4) Translating text into regional language can give chance for people to learn more in local language.
5) Converting the text into audio: The text retrieved from scanned images, will be converted to audio to assist differently abled people.
